# SudokuSolver

A sudoku solver that checks if a unique solution exists. 

If multiple solutions exist, it gives you the option to iterate through all possible solutions, outputting the total number of solutions. (Warning, this might take a while)

Only the first valid solution will get printed.

To enter a grid, you must open up solverBacktrack.py and input the grid into the 2d array at the top.
